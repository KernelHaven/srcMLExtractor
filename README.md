## License
This extractor is licensed under GPLv3. Another license would be possible with following restrictions:

The extractor contains [srcML](http://srcml.org/) which is under GPL-3.0. We do not link against [srcML](http://srcml.org/), so technically we are not infected by GPL. However a release under a license other than GPL-3.0 would require the removal of the contained [srcML](http://srcml.org/).
