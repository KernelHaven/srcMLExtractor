- XmlToAstConverter / XmlPreprocessor
    - Handle the following code:
            #ifdef A
                int
            #else
                float
            #endif
                a;
        -> this causes the <decl_stmt> to end too early
    - convertToCode()
        - Handle <kh:reference> nodes
    - Review child detection with srcML documentation
        - don't search nested by name anymore (purge getChildren())?
    - <cpp:if*> parsing (C preprocessor)
        - Line continuation
